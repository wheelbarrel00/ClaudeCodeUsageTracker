## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Status-bar item showing today's estimated cost and token count, with
  independent `showCost` / `showTokens` toggles. Click to open the dashboard.
- Plan-limit utilization in the status bar: 5-hour and weekly windows
  (`5h X% · wk Y%`) read from Claude Code's `~/.claude/usage-cache.json`, gated
  on `showLimits`. The bar tints to the server-reported severity, and the
  tooltip lists each window's reset time and scoped models.
- `showOpusWeekly` opt-in (default off) that appends the weekly Opus limit
  (`opus Z%`) after the 5h / weekly figures when a live Opus window exists.
- Dashboard webview: Today / This Month / All Time cards with an input / output
  / cache-write / cache-read token breakdown, plus a Plan limits section with a
  progress bar, reset time, and severity color per window.
- Per-model and per-project breakdown tables, scoped by a Today / This Month /
  All Time tab that persists across refreshes.
- Cost estimates from a per-model price table with prefix matching for dated /
  suffixed model ids.
- Live updates via file watchers over `~/.claude/projects` and
  `usage-cache.json`, with a polling timer as a fallback.
- Parsed logs cached per file by mtime to avoid re-reading unchanged sessions.
